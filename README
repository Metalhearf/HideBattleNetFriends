# Dragonflight users (>10.x.x)
I won't be supporting versions after 9.2.7 for now.
Please check out [this version](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/hide-battle-net), which is way more polished (adds way more customization). 

# TL;DR
This addon hides Battle.net (Real ID and BattleTag) friends from the in-game friends list.

# Description
Useful for streamers or content creators that don't want to remove the "Real ID" option from their account when sharing moments of the game, while also protecting their friend's privacy.
Plus, it also it declutters the in-game friend list "just like the good old days".

### Considerations:
- This addon does not interfere with the Battle.net app : it just hides your friends from the WoW in-game friends list. As such, it will only show people you have friended per character.
- Your friends can still see you online, you can still receive whispers from them in game, you can still reply to those whispers, and you can still add and accept Battle.net friend requests.

# Details
Fork from Hide Battle.net Friends, I'm willing to make it easily available for ~~WoW Retail~~, WoW Classic & WoW Burning Crusade and WoW Wrath of The Lich King.
